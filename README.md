**Evaluating the Effectiveness of Terraform-Deployed AWS Serverless Architecture for Threat Detection and Compliance Automation**

**Project Description**
This project investigates and evaluates a serverless AWS security architecture, deployed via Terraform, to detect threats and enforce compliance automatically. With the growing adoption of serverless computing, traditional security mechanisms fall short in identifying and remediating dynamic cloud threats. This research aims to fill this gap by integrating AWS-native services such as Lambda, CloudTrail, GuardDuty, AWS Config, SNS, and Security Hub in a Terraform-driven pipeline.

**Core Focus:**
Real-time threat detection using AWS-native tools.

Auto-remediation of misconfigurations and malicious activities.

Compliance validation using AWS Config.

Comparative evaluation against:

A traditional server-based AWS setup (deployed via CLI and Terraform).

Lavi et al. (2024)’s model that focuses only on detection, not remediation.

**Objectives**
1.Design and deploy a Terraform-based serverless AWS architecture for real-time security monitoring.

2.Simulate benign and malicious Lambda functions for threat testing.

3.Test against CloudGoat and AWS GuardDuty Tester scenarios including:
a.Privilege escalation
b.SSRF
c.Resource abuse

Compare:

1.Detection accuracy
2.Auto-remediation speed
3.Compliance enforcement
4.Deployment effort (manual vs automated)

Demonstrate advantages of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for secure, scalable cloud deployments.

Architecture Overview
Serverless Architecture (Terraform-Deployed)
Lambda for detection and remediation

CloudTrail + CloudWatch for monitoring and alerting

GuardDuty for threat detection

AWS Config for compliance validation

SNS for alert distribution

Security Hub for unified threat visibility

Terraform for complete IaC-based deployment

**Server-Based Architectures (Baselines)**
Manually deployed EC2 log monitoring setup (via CLI)

Terraform-deployed EC2-based log forwarding pipeline

**Baseline comparison with Lavi et al. (2024) detection-only model**

**Attack Simulation Tools**
CloudGoat – Simulates IAM privilege escalation, Lambda abuse, and SSRF

AWS GuardDuty Tester – Generates real GuardDuty findings for:

SSH brute-force

Port scanning

DNS exfiltration

IAM abuse

**Evaluation Metrics**
Metric	Description
1. Detection Accuracy	If the architecture detects each attack
2. Time-to-Detect	Time from attack initiation to alert
3. Remediation Effectiveness	Was auto-remediation successfully triggered?
4. False Positives	Are alerts relevant and valid?
5. Reproducibility	Can the setup be deployed identically in other environments?
6. Compliance Score	AWS Config rule violations before/after remediation

**Tools & Technologies**
Terraform – Infrastructure as Code

AWS Lambda, EC2, S3, CloudTrail, Config, SNS, CloudWatch

Amazon GuardDuty, Security Hub

CloudGoat, AWS GuardDuty Tester

Checkov – Terraform misconfiguration scanning

**Project Status**
Server-based architectures implemented

Terraform modules completed for server-based architecture setups

Need to check on Event-driven auto-remediation with Lambda + EventBridge.
(e.g., misconfigurations) and SNS Notifications: Sends alerts to email

Along with that need to work on forwarding logs from security hub and guardduty to s3 bucket

Need to simulate more attacks and identify which attacks being detected and which are not.

Need to setup a few misconfigurations so that AWS config can check for compliance and auto-remediation and the same which event bridge and lambda functions.

Study on GuardDuty tester attack simulation and work on setup as it is approved by AWS

Setup Bengin and malicious lambda functions for triggering GuardDuty detection

Collect all the logs and start the comparison and evaluation process

Alternatively, try to document each and everything so that can write FPR simultaneously.

Comparative analysis and evaluation scheduled for August 2025

Research Questions
RQ1: How effective is a serverless AWS security architecture in detecting and remediating threats using AWS-native services?

RQ2: How do manual vs Terraform-deployed server-based setups compare in terms of scalability, consistency, and security?

Comparative Evaluation
